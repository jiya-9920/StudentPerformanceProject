📘 Student Performance Prediction
--

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a student will pass or fail, based on demographic and academic features.
The project includes full model training, evaluation, and deployment using Flask and Render.

🧠 Model Used
--
The deployed model is:

⭐ Logistic Regression (best-performing model)

1)Selected after comparing multiple models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.

2)Logistic Regression achieved the highest balanced performance and was saved as:
  student_model.pkl

📊 Dataset Description

--

This project uses the Students Performance in Exams dataset from Kaggle, which contains demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information about students.
It includes 1,000 records, where each row represents one student.

🔗 Dataset Source:

Features
--

1)gender – Male or Female

2)race/ethnicity – Student’s ethnic group (A–E)

3)parental level of education – Highest education level of the student's parents

4)lunch – Type of lunch support (standard or free/reduced)

5)test preparation course – Completed or not completed

6)math score, reading score, writing score – Exam performance (0–100)

Target Variable

-Pass/Fail Classification

   -Created using the mean of math, reading, and writing scores

   -Students with an average ≥ 60% → Pass

  -Students with an average < 60% → Fail

This dataset is widely used to explore how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence academic outcomes and is ideal for building classification models.
