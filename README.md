🧠 Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning
--
📄 Overview
--
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will pass or fail based on demographic, socioeconomic, and academic attributes such as gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and exam scores.
The objective is to understand how non-academic factors influence student outcomes and to build a robust machine learning model that can predict performance accurately. The project also includes deployment as a live web application, enabling real-time predictions.

--
🎯 Objectives
--
1)To analyze how demographic and socioeconomic factors affect student performance

2)To identify patterns that contribute to academic success or failure

3)To compare multiple machine learning algorithms for classification

4)To deploy a real-time prediction system using a web interface

5)To demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow: data → model → deployment

Source:
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

Description:
The dataset contains 1,000 student records, where each record represents an individual student’s background and academic performance.

Features:
1)Gender – Male / Female

2)Race/Ethnicity – Group A to E

3)Parental Level of Education – Highest education of parents

4)Lunch – Standard or Free/Reduced

5)Test Preparation Course – Completed / Not Completed

6)Math Score (0–100)

7)Reading Score (0–100)

8)Writing Score (0–100)
--
🎯 Target Variable
--
Pass / Fail Classification
1)Average of math, reading, and writing scores calculated
2)Average ≥ 60% → Pass
3)Average < 60% → Fail
